# App Store Management

This guide covers how to manage the Crossloadr app store, including app submissions, reviews, and ongoing maintenance.

## App Submission Process

### For Developers

1. **Prepare Your App**
   - Ensure your web app meets the [security requirements](./security.md)
   - Prepare app metadata:
     - App name
     - Description
     - Category
     - Icon (512x512 PNG recommended)
     - Website URL
     - Developer information
     - Version number
     - System requirements

2. **Submit Your App**
   - Navigate to `/submit` in the app store
   - Fill out the submission form
   - Upload app icon
   - Submit for review

3. **Track Submission Status**
   - View status at `/developer/dashboard`
   - Receive email notifications for status changes
   - Respond to any review requests

### For Administrators

1. **Review Process**
   - Access admin dashboard at `/admin`. (Note: Admin login is at `/admin/login`)
   - The dashboard features separate tabs for "Pending", "Active", and "Suspended" applications.
   - View pending submissions in the "Pending" tab.
   - Review app details and `scanResult` (latest scan information) for each app.
   - Approve or reject with feedback.
   - If approving an app with "Not Scanned" or "Scan Failed" status, a confirmation dialog will appear.

2. **Security Scan**
   - Automatic scan on submission
   - Manual rescan available
   - Review scan results:
     - SSL certificate
     - Content security
     - XSS protection
     - Data privacy

## App Management

### Categories

Manage app categories in the admin dashboard:

1. **Add Category**
   - Navigate to `/admin/categories`
   - Click "Add Category"
   - Enter category name and description
   - Set display order

2. **Edit Category**
   - Update name or description
   - Reorder categories
   - Archive unused categories

### App Status Management

Apps can have the following statuses:
- `pending` - Awaiting review
- `active` - Approved and available
- `suspended` - Temporarily removed from public view
- `rejected` - Failed review

To change app status:

1. **Suspend an App**
   - Navigate to the "Active" tab in the admin dashboard.
   - Click the "Suspend" icon button for the desired app.
   - Confirm the suspension. Suspended apps are immediately removed from the public store.
   - The app's status will change to 'suspended'.

2. **Reactivate an App**
   - Navigate to the "Suspended" tab in the admin dashboard.
   - Click the "Reactivate" icon button for the desired app.
   - Confirm the reactivation.
   - The app's status will change to 'active', it will become available in the public store again, and its mobileconfig profile will be re-generated.
   - Verify any previous issues are resolved if necessary (manual step).

3. **Remove an App**
   - Navigate to app details
   - Click "Remove App"
   - Confirm removal
   - Archive app data

## Content Moderation

### Review Guidelines

1. **App Content**
   - No illegal content
   - No malware or harmful code
   - Clear privacy policy
   - Appropriate for intended audience

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Valid SSL certificate
   - Secure content delivery
   - Proper error handling
   - Responsive design

3. **User Experience**
   - Clear navigation
   - Fast loading times
   - Mobile-friendly design
   - Accessible interface

### PWA Fullscreen Experience
- Web Clip profiles generated by the system now include `IgnoreManifestScope: true`. This enhances the fullscreen experience for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) launched from the Home Screen, making them behave more like native apps or PWAs manually added to the Home Screen. Developers should still ensure their web apps include appropriate meta tags (`apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, etc.) for the best results.

### Moderation Tools

1. **Report Handling**
   - Review user reports
   - Investigate issues
   - Take appropriate action
   - Document decisions

2. **Bulk Actions**
   - Mass category updates
   - Batch status changes
   - Bulk security scans
   - Export app data

## Analytics and Reporting

### App Store Metrics

Monitor key metrics in the admin dashboard:

1. **Usage Statistics**
   - Daily active users
   - Installation counts
   - Category popularity
   - User ratings

2. **Performance Metrics**

   - Error rates
   - Security scan results
   - User feedback

        http://localhost:3000/api/admin/reports/apps/performance \
        -o app-performance-report.csv
   ```

2. **Security Status**
   ```bash
   # Export security report
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:3000/api/admin/reports/security \

   ```
